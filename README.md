# Farm Cart

Farm Cart is a Flask-based web application that serves as an online marketplace for farmers to list, manage, and sell their products directly to consumers. It provides features for farmers to add products, manage orders, view insights, and interact with customers through a contact form. The application is built with a focus on simplicity, security, and usability, using Tailwind CSS for styling and SQLite for data storage.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Farmers can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
- **Product Management**: Farmers can add, edit, and view their product listings with details like name, description, price, quantity, and shipping options.
- **Order Management**: Farmers can view and update the status of orders received (as sellers) and track orders placed (as buyers).
- **Dashboard**: A centralized dashboard provides quick access to orders, products, insights, and customer support, with summary statistics.
- **Insights**: Location-based product and crop recommendations, including a profit graph for suggested crops (specific to Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh).
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search products by name/description and filter by farmer name.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for registering farmers, managing products, and placing orders programmatically.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js (for insights graph)
